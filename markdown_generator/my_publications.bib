	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The on-going environmental crisis poses an urgent need for predicting future extinction events, which can aid with targeting conservation efforts. Commonly, such predictions are made based on conservation status assessments produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, when researchers apply these conservation status data for predicting future extinctions, important information is often omitted, which can majorly impact the accuracy of these predictions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Here we present iucn\_sim, a command line program, which implements an improved approach for simulating future extinctions based on IUCN status data. In contrast to previous approaches, iucn\_sim explicitly models future changes in conservation status for each species, based on information derived from the IUCN assessment history of the last decades. Additionally the program considers generation length information when translating status information into extinction probabilities, as intended per IUCN definition.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The program implements a Markov-chain Monte Carlo estimation of extinction rates for each species, based on the simulated extinctions. These estimates inherently contain the chances of conservation status changes and the generation length of each given species.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Based on an empirical data example including all birds (class Aves), we find that our improved approach has a strong effect on the estimated species-specific extinction rates as well as on the overall number of predicted extinctions. Using simulated data we show that iucn\_sim reliably estimates extinction rates with high accuracy if run for a sufficient number of simulations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {To elucidate the relationships and spatial range evolution across the world of the bird genus Turdus (Aves), we produced a large genomic dataset comprising ca 2 million nucleotides for ca 100 samples representing 53 species, including over 2000 loci. We estimated time-calibrated maximum-likelihood and multispecies coalescent phylogenies and carried out biogeographic analyses. Our results indicate that there have been considerably fewer trans-oceanic dispersals within the genus Turdus than previously suggested, such that the Palaearctic clade did not originate in America and the African clade was not involved in the colonization of the Americas. Instead, our findings suggest that dispersal from the Western Palaearctic via the Antilles to the Neotropics might have occurred in a single event, giving rise to the rich Neotropical diversity of Turdus observed today, with no reverse dispersals to the Palaearctic or Africa. Our large multilocus dataset, combined with dense species-level sampling and analysed under probabilistic methods, brings important insights into historical biogeography and systematics, even in a scenario of fast and spatially complex diversification.},

	abstract = {High-throughput DNA sequencing techniques enable time- and cost-effective sequencing of large portions of the genome. Instead of sequencing and annotating whole genomes, many phylogenetic studies focus sequencing efforts on large sets of pre-selected loci, which further reduces costs and bioinformatic challenges while increasing sequencing depth. One common approach that enriches loci before sequencing is often referred to as target sequence capture. This technique has been shown to be applicable to phylogenetic studies of greatly varying evolutionary depth and has proven to produce powerful, large multi-locus DNA sequence datasets of selected loci, suitable for phylogenetic analyses. However, target capture requires careful theoretical and practical considerations, which will greatly affect the success of the experiment. Here we provide an easy-to-follow flowchart for adequately designing phylogenomic target capture experiments, and we discuss necessary considerations and decisions from the first steps in the lab to the final bioinformatic processing of the sequence data. We particularly discuss issues and challenges related to the taxonomic scope, sample quality, and available genomic resources of target capture projects and how these issues affect all steps from bait design to the bioinformatic processing of the data. Altogether this review outlines a roadmap for future target capture experiments and is intended to assist researchers with making informed decisions for designing and carrying out successful phylogenetic target capture studies.},

The current bottleneck is how to efficiently handle, process, and analyze such large amounts of data in an automated and reproducible way. To tackle these challenges we introduce the Sequence Capture Processor (SECAPR) pipeline for processing raw sequencing data into multiple sequence alignments for downstream phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses. SECAPR is user-friendly and we provide an exhaustive empirical data tutorial intended for users with no prior experience with analyzing MPS output. SECAPR is particularly useful for the processing of sequence capture (synonyms: target or hybrid enrichment) datasets for non-model organisms, as we demonstrate using an empirical sequence capture dataset of the palm genus Geonoma (Arecaceae). Various quality control and plotting functions help the user to decide on the most suitable settings for even challenging datasets. SECAPR is an easy-to-use, free, and versatile pipeline, aimed to enable efficient and reproducible processing of MPS data for many samples in parallel.},

	abstract = {Deep Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are a powerful tool, though computationally demanding, to perform parameter estimation while jointly estimating uncertainty around predictions. BNNs are typically implemented using arbitrary normal-distributed prior distributions on the model parameters. Here, we explore the eﬀects of diﬀerent prior distributions on classiﬁcation tasks in BNNs and evaluate the evidence supporting the predictions based on posterior probabilities approximated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and by computing Bayes factors. We show that the choice of priors has a substantial impact on the ability of the model to conﬁdently assign data to the correct class (true positive rates). Prior choice also aﬀects signiﬁcantly the ability of a BNN to identify out-of-distribution instances as unknown (false positive rates). When comparing our results against neural networks (NN) with Monte Carlo dropout we found that BNNs generally outperform NNs. Finally, in our tests we did not ﬁnd a single best choice as prior distribution. Instead, each dataset yielded the best results under a diﬀerent prior, indicating that testing alternative options can improve the performance of BNNs.},
